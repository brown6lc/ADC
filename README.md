FPGA ADC Interface Project

This repository contains an FPGA-based Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) interface implemented using Verilog/VHDL and reference materials sourced from Digilent’s open-source repositories. The project demonstrates how to interface an FPGA board with an external analog input, perform digital conversion, and stream the sampled data for further processing.
